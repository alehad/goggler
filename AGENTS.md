# Repository Guidance

This repository uses OpenSpec to drive planning and implementation.

Before implementing behavior, create or update an OpenSpec change under `openspec/changes/`. Accepted behavior should later be reflected under `openspec/specs/`.

## Project Direction

goggler is a personal-first eBay UK auction tracker. It imports authenticated buying history, tracks items the user did not win, searches for likely exact relistings, and presents matches in an app dashboard.

## Git Workflow

- Do development work on short-lived branches using the `codex/` prefix by default.
- Open pull requests from feature branches into `main`.
- Merge to `main` only after the user has confirmed the PR should be merged.
- After a PR is merged, delete the feature branch on GitHub and locally unless the user asks to keep it.
- Keep `main` clean and up to date before starting new work.
